What did you have to learn, what did you find you didn't know enough about from the earlier 
 assignments and lessons?

Where did you learn it, what resources did you use?  Links to official documentation and examples 
 online are reasonable resources.

What challenges did you encounter?  What parts were really challenging about the project? 
  What ended up being exceptionally time consuming?


How did you work around those challenges?  
 Did you ask for help? 
 Look at additional resources/examples? 
 Change the way you tried to solve the problem? 
 Changed the scope/content of the project to avoid the complication?  
 Work through it but still haven't found a better way?


If you had to build an application needing access to data in the future, how would you do it?  
 Would you use the same application language?  Library?  DBMS?  
 Knowing what you know now, would you take a different approach to solving the problem?
